    "Greenhouse gas emissions from transport account for 25% of the total EU greenhouse gas emissions. In order to achieve climate neutrality by 2050, as specified in the European Green Deal, there is a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector by 90%. $^2$\n",

    "In the current era of globalization, a clean environment remains a crucial factor for the health of the population. Thus, improving air quality is a major focus of environmental policies, as it affects all aspects of nature, including humans. For these reasons, it is appropriate to take into account the health risks posed by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere. With regard to global GHG emissions, there are concerns about the loss of protection of the ozone layer and it is very likely that climate change can be expected, which multiplies the environmental threat and has potentially serious global consequences.  $CO_2$ emissions have a dominant position among selected GHG emissions. The revealed positive link between $CO_2$ and DALYs indicated that a decrease in $CO_2$ may be associated with a decrease in DALYs, but it is also true that this cannot be done without reducing emissions of other combustion products. $^4$\n",

The reported emissions are based on type-approval and can deviate from the actual $CO_2$ emissions of new cars. Since 2021, the emissions are measured with a new test procedure (Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Procedure WLTP), compared to the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) procedure used until 2020. The WLTP aims to reflect better real driving conditions and WLTP values are systematically higher than NEDC values. This change leads to a break in time series between 2020 and 2021.\n"

The impact on the environment goes beyond just using the car, and it's crucial to look at the whole life cycle.

So, including data from the manufacturing phase is really important to get a complete picture of how different types of motors affect the environment.\n",

For example, it can help policymakers assess the effectiveness of emissions standards and regulations over the lifespan of a vehicle.
